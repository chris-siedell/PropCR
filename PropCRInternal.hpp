#pragma mark - HostTransactionInitiator

    // Transactions may be started on any thread at any time.
    //  Transactions are performed one at a time on a special worker thread (the transaction
    //  thread) which exists for the life of the host object. The HostTransactionInitiator is a
    //  scope-based object for handing off a transaction from the intiating thread to the
    //  transaction thread.
    // If the host is busy when the initiator is created it will throw IsBusyError, so if the
    //  initiator object exists then the transaction is free to proceed.
    // Between the initiator creation and the startTransaction call the following are
    //  guaranteed:
    //  - No transactions are being performed or can begin. So there is no concurrent
    //    t_performTransaction call.
    //  - Only one initiator object can exist in that state at a time (i.e. created, but without
    //    a transaction started). So the code in that interval never runs concurrently.
    // These guarantees allow setting up the transaction in a thread safe way.
    // Throwing an exception between creating the intiator object and calling startTransaction
    //  is OK -- the host will be free to start another transaction.
    // Calling startTransaction signals to the transaction thread that there is a transaction
    //  to be performed. Eventually, this means that the host's t_performTransaction will be
    //  called on the transaction thread with the original transaction argument that was passed
    //  to startTransaction. Any other parameters that your t_performTransaction code needs to
    //  do its work should have been saved in between the initiator creation and the
    //  startTransaction call.
    // The call to startTransaction is also when the transaction specific settings are locked in.
    //  E.g. calling setBaudrate after that point won't affect the baudrate of the transaction.
    // startTransaction must not be called more than once.
    // The context is a pointer that is provided to the monitor callbacks. It may be ignored.
    // startTransaction has to be called on the thread the initiator was created on (shouldn't
    //  normally be a problem).
    // todo: consider alternative for blocking (instead of throwing IsBusyError), maybe with timeout
